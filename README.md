##React for Designers
http://reactfordesigners.com/labs/reactjs-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by/
This is a ground-level introduction to React for people that know JQuery but don't necessariy understand the more abstract concepts, right off the bat. It adds a literal example, and compares/contrasts how things work in JQuery vs. React. 

##React.js Fundamentals 
http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/
This is a course that provides an introduction to React. Having only gone through the first few videos, it gives a good introduction to some of the more abstract and/or overarching concepts that get tossed around like 'declarative programming'. 

##The Official Facebook Docs
https://facebook.github.io/react/
Of course, the official documentation should be the go-to point for questions.
